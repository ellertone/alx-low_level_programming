Pointer is a variable which contains a memory address.
A pointer is simply the address of a piece of data in memory. A pointer variable is a variable that stores the address of that piece of data. Like any other variable it needs to be declared. General form is:

var_type *var;

Arrays in C are contiguous memory areas that hold a number of values of the same type. Unlike some other languages, in C, all elements of an array have the same type. To declare an array we use this syntax: type var_name[number_of_elements];, where number_of_elements is the number of elements of type type that we need.
